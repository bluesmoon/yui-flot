Flot 0.2
--------

Added support for putting a background behind the default legend. The
default is the partly transparent background color. Added
backgroundColor and backgroundOpacity to the legend options to control
this.

The ticks options can now be a callback function that takes one
parameter, an object with the attributes min and max. The function
should return a ticks array.

Added labelFormatter option in legend, useful for turning the legend
labels into links.

Fixed a couple of bugs.

The API should now be fully documented.

Patch from Guy Fraser to make parts of the code smaller.

API changes: Moved labelMargin option to grid from x/yaxis.
